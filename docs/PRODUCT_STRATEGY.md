## 1. Competitive Landscape

This section analyzes the competitive position of the Conxius Wallet against key players in the market.

*   **Metamask/Phantom:** These wallets are the dominant players in the EVM and Solana ecosystems, respectively.
    *   **Strengths:** Large user base, extensive dApp integrations.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Not Bitcoin-native, rely on browser extensions, and do not offer the same level of security as a hardware wallet.
    *   **Conxius's Edge:** Conxius is a "Bitcoin-First" wallet that provides hardware-level security through its on-device TEE (Conclave). This offers a significant security advantage over browser-based wallets.

*   **Xverse:** A leading wallet in the Stacks ecosystem.
    *   **Strengths:** Strong focus on the Stacks ecosystem, good user experience.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Limited to the Stacks ecosystem, does not offer the same multi-chain capabilities as Conxius.
    *   **Conxius's Edge:** Conxius is a multi-chain wallet that supports a wider range of Bitcoin layers, including Rootstock and Liquid. This makes it a more versatile option for users who want to explore the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.

## 2. The "Conclave Gap" - Our Value Proposition

The "Conclave Gap" is the space in the market for a wallet that offers the security of a hardware wallet with the convenience of a software wallet. Conxius fills this gap with its on-device TEE (Conclave), which provides "Hardware-level security without the dongle."

## 3. Sovereign User Persona

The "Sovereign User Persona" is the target user for the Conxius Wallet. This user is:

*   **Security-conscious:** They understand the importance of self-custody and are looking for a wallet that offers the highest level of security.
*   **A Bitcoin enthusiast:** They are interested in exploring the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, not just a single L2 or sidechain.
*   **A power user:** They are comfortable with advanced features like multi-sig and are looking for a wallet that can grow with them.
