# Approved Partners & Compliance Stack

**Objective:** Enable financial features by integrating regulated third-party APIs while maintaining non-custodial sovereignty.

## 1. Fiat On-Ramps (Buying Crypto)
* **Provider:** **Transak**
* **Status:** APPROVED

* **Compliance Role:** Counterparty for trades. Handles AML screening.
* **Infrastructure Pivot (M12):** Conxian Labs operates a **Technical Relay Proxy** for Changelly to ensure uptime and privacy. This proxy does not hold or possess the ability to redirect funds.

## 4. Institutional Interface (B2B)

* **Status:** APPROVED
* **Compliance Role:** Technology provider. Keys stay in the user's Conclave.
* **Note:** We do NOT act as the routing node (LSP) to avoid Money Transmitter licensing.

## 6. Developer Rules of Engagement (Strict Adherence)
1.  **Never Touch Fiat:** Do not build any feature that accepts card payments directly to Conxian Labs accounts.
2.  **No Shadow Ledgers:** Never record a user's balance in our own database. Always fetch live data from the blockchain or the Partner API.
3.  **UI Labeling:** When a user enters a partner flow (e.g., Buying BTC), display a toast/banner: *"Powered by [Partner Name]. You are leaving Conxius to complete this transaction."*
4.  **Non-Custodial Proxying:** Any proxy operated by Conxian Labs must be verified to be a "Zero-Touch" relay that cannot modify transaction destinations.
