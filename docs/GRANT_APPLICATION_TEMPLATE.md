# Grant Application Template

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Conxius Wallet

**One-Liner:** A "Bitcoin-First" mobile wallet with hardware-level security, powered by an on-device TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).

**Problem:** The Bitcoin ecosystem is expanding rapidly with the growth of L2s and sidechains. However, there is a lack of mobile wallets that offer both high security and seamless multi-chain support.

**Solution:** The Conxius Wallet bridges this gap by providing a single, secure, and user-friendly interface for managing assets across the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Technical Strengths

*   **On-Device TEE (Conclave):** Our on-device TEE provides hardware-level security without the need for a separate hardware device. This is a significant security advantage over other mobile wallets.
*   **Multi-Chain Support:** We support a wide range of Bitcoin L2s and sidechains, including Stacks, Rootstock, and Liquid.
*   **Wormhole NTT Integration:** Our integration with Wormhole NTT enables seamless cross-chain asset transfers.
*   **"Bitcoin-First" Philosophy:** We are committed to the "Bitcoin-First" philosophy and believe that Bitcoin is the foundation of the decentralized internet.

## Grant Request

We are seeking a grant to support the following initiatives:

*   **[Initiative 1]:** [Description of initiative]
*   **[Initiative 2]:** [Description of initiative]
*   **[Initiative 3]:** [Description of initiative]

We believe that these initiatives will help to grow the [Stacks/Wormhole] ecosystem and make it more accessible to a wider range of users.

## Team

The Conxius Wallet team is composed of experienced engineers and designers with a passion for Bitcoin and decentralized technologies. We have a proven track record of shipping high-quality products and are confident that we can deliver on our promises.
