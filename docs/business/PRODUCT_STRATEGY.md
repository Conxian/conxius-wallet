# Conxius Product Strategy: The Sovereign Super-App

**Vision:** To be the single, secure gateway for the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, bridging the gap between hardware-grade security and mobile-first utility.

## 1. The Conclave Gap (Value Proposition)

Market analysis reveals a critical void:
- **Hardware Wallets:** High security, zero mobility, high friction.
- **Hot Wallets:** High utility, high risk, vulnerable to OS exploits.
- **The Conclave Solution:** Mobile TEE (StrongBox) isolation provides hardware-grade security with the seamless UX of a modern smartphone.

## 2. Competitive Dominance: "Lowest Yet Profitable"

Conxius wins on two fronts:
1.  **Price Dominance:** Our SAF (Sovereignty-Adjusted Fee) model ensures we are 70-80% cheaper than MetaMask and Phantom.
2.  **Security Dominance:** We are the only mobile wallet enforcing StrongBox-backed signing for all Bitcoin layers (L1, L2, Sidechains).

## 3. The Sovereign Retention Cycle (The Flywheel)

Our growth is driven by a self-reinforcing loop:

### Phase A: Acquisition (The "Magnetic Low-Fee" Hook)
We use disruptively low fees (0.1% bridge/swap) and gas abstraction (pay gas in sBTC) to pull users from high-fee ecosystems.

### Phase B: Activation (Sovereignty Quests)
Users are gamified into securing their accounts.
*   **Quest 1: The Vault:** Enable StrongBox/TEE.
*   **Quest 2: The Ghost:** Enable Tor routing.
*   **Quest 3: The Sentry:** Verify physical backups.
*   **Reward:** Completing these quests increases the **Sovereignty Score**, which directly lowers transaction fees.

### Phase C: Retention (Sovereign Lock-in)
Once a user has achieved a high Sovereignty Score and low fee tier, the "switching cost" to another wallet is high—not just in terms of technical friction, but in financial loss (higher fees elsewhere).

### Phase D: Monetization (Pro & B2B Expansion)
Retained users upgrade to **Conclave Pro**. Massive retail activity creates the "Lindy Effect" required to sell the **Conclave SDK** to institutional partners.

## 4. Multi-Layer Roadmap

| Milestone | Feature | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **M1: Foundations** | StrongBox Core, BIP-39, L1 BTC | COMPLETED |
| **M2: Interop** | Liquid, Stacks, Boltz Swaps | COMPLETED |
| **M3: The Bridge** | Wormhole NTT, sBTC-as-Gas | COMPLETED |
| **M4: Privacy** | Tor, Silent Payments, CoinJoin | IN PROGRESS |
| **M5: Proofs** | BitVM Verifier, STARK verification | COMPLETED |
| **M6: Enterprise** | Conclave SDK v1, Institutional API | Q3 2026 |

## 5. Success Metrics (Dynamic Monitoring)
*   **Total Sovereignty Score (TSS):** Aggregate security health of the user base.
*   **Protocol Revenue Per User (PRPU):** Diversified income across fees, SaaS, and B2B.
*   **Churn-to-Fee Ratio:** Correlating fee competitiveness with user retention.
