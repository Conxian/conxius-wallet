# Conxius Monetization Strategy: The Sovereign Revenue Model

**Philosophy:** Conxius is a **Software Provider**. Revenue is generated through **Licensing**, **Technology Services**, and **Affiliate Referrals**. We strictly **do not** charge management fees, hold custody of funds, or act as a money transmitter.

## 1. Revenue Streams

### 1.1 The Sovereign Bridge (Gas Abstraction & NTT) 🌉

**Concept:** A technical bridge allowing users to move assets between chains natively using Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT).

*   **Mechanism:** Users perform NTT via the Conxius interface.
*   **Convenience Fee:** A **0.1% technology integration fee** is applied to the gross value of cross-chain transfers, capped at $50.
*   **Gas Abstraction Model:**
    *   **The Problem:** Moving sBTC from Stacks to Ethereum usually requires ETH for gas on the destination.
    *   **The Solution:** Conxius allows the user to pay for destination gas in **sBTC**. We utilize a network of "Solvers" (Relayers) who accept sBTC and pay the ETH gas. Conxius captures a **Solver Rebate** from the service provider for routing this volume.

### 1.2 B2B SDK Licensing (The "Infrastructure" Layer) 🏢

**Concept:** Packaging the "Conclave" TEE technology for 3rd-party integration.

*   **Target:** Fintechs, Neo-banks, and Institutional Treasury providers who want to offer "Hardware-grade" security to their own mobile users.
*   **Model:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Startup):** $2,500 / month flat fee (up to 10k users).
    *   **Tier 2 (Enterprise):** $10,000 / month + volume-based signing fees.
*   **Value Prop:** Instant compliance with "StrongBox-backed" security requirements for high-value transaction signing.

### 1.3 Network Utility Services (The "Speed" Layer) ⚡

*   **LSP Routing Fees (Breez/Greenlight):** As an LSP partner, we earn a share of the routing fees for liquidity provided to user channels.
*   **Transaction Accelerator ("Turbo Boost"):** Users pay a premium (service fee) to accelerate stuck Bitcoin transactions via RBF/CPFP partners.

### 1.4 Affiliate Commissions (The "Referral" Layer) 🛡️

*   **Hardware Affiliates:** BitBox02, Trezor, Ledger (10-15% commission).
*   **"Live on Crypto" (Bitrefill):** 1% of total volume for gift card/utility purchases.
*   **Sovereign Swaps (THORChain/Boltz):** 10-50 bps affiliate fee appended to swap memos.

### 1.5 Premium Software Features (SaaS)

*   **"Conclave Pro" Subscription:** $9.99/mo for advanced multi-sig tools, dedicated Tor bridges, and AI-powered UTXO privacy scouting.

## 2. Prohibited Revenue Models (The "Red Lines")

To maintain our "Software Provider" regulatory status, Conxian Labs **strictly prohibits**:

*   **x** Taking a percentage of "Assets Under Management" (AUM).
*   **x** Charging "Performance Fees" or guaranteeing returns.
*   **x** Internal market making or spread capture on user trades.
*   **x** Holding user fiat in a Conxian bank account.
