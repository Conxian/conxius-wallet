# Conxius Monetization Strategy

**Philosophy:** Conxius is a **Software Provider**. Revenue is generated through **Licensing**, **Technology Services**, and **Affiliate Referrals**. We strictly **do not** charge management fees, hold custody of funds, or act as a money transmitter.

## 1. Revenue Streams

### 1.1 Affiliate Commissions (The "Referral" Layer)

We earn a referral fee for connecting users to third-party regulated financial services.

#### "Sovereign Shield" Shop (Hardware Affiliates) 🛡️

**Verdict:** **Lowest Effort / High Trust**
Curated security recommendation list. We do not sell hardware; we recommend the best tools for sovereignty.

* **BitBox02 (Best Fit):**
  * **Why:** Swiss-made, open-source firmware, Bitcoin-only friendly.
  * **Revenue:** **12% commission** (Paid in Bitcoin).
  * **Integration:** Direct "Buy BitBox02" link in Security section.
* **Trezor:**
  * **Why:** The OG hardware wallet. High brand recognition.
  * **Revenue:** **12-15% commission**.
* **Ledger:**
  * **Why:** Market volume leader.
  * **Revenue:** **10% commission**.

#### "Live on Crypto" Mode (Bitrefill Integration) 🛒

**Verdict:** **High Utility / Recurring Revenue**
Turns Conxius into a daily driver for South African users.

* **The Hook:** Buy Checkers, Takealot, Mr D, Uber, and Airtime with Bitcoin/Lightning.
* **Revenue:** **1% of total volume** forever (Passive).
* **Integration:** "Spend" tab/button in Dashboard opening `bitrefill.com/?ref=[YourID]`.

#### Sovereign Swaps (Changelly & THORChain) 🔄

**Verdict:** **Highest Potential / Native Feel**

* **Option A: Changelly**
  * **How:** API integration.
  * **Revenue:** 50% revenue share of their fee.
  * **Legal Note:** User acts directly with Changelly; Conxius provides the UI.

* **Option B: THORChain (The Sovereign Route)**
  * **How:** Native L1 swaps (BTC -> ETH/Stables).
  * **Revenue:** **Affiliate Basis Points (10-50 bps)** appended to the swap memo.
  * **Requirement:** Register "conxius" name on THORChain.

### 1.2 Network Utility Services (The "Speed" Layer) ⚡

Revenue generated by providing technical access to faster network infrastructure.

* **LSP Routing Fees (Breez/Greenlight):**
  * **Mechanism:** As an LSP partner, we earn a share of the routing fees for liquidity provided to user channels.
  * **Verdict:** **Passive / High Scale**.
* **Transaction Accelerator ("Turbo Boost"):**
  * **Mechanism:** Users pay a premium to accelerate stuck Bitcoin transactions (RBF/CPFP).
  * **Revenue:** We retain a service fee on top of the mining fee paid to the acceleration partner.

### 1.3 Premium Software Features (SaaS)

* **"Conclave Pro" Subscription:**
  * **Model:** Monthly/Yearly software license.
  * **Features:**
    * Multi-sig coordination tools.
    * Advanced UTXO management (Coin Control).
    * **High-Speed Privacy:** Dedicated, high-bandwidth Tor bridges and Nostr relays (replacing slow public relays).
* **B2B SDK Licensing:**
    * The "Conclave" TEE technology packaged as a B2B SDK for other wallets.

### 1.4 The Sovereign Bridge (Gas Abstraction) 🌉

**Concept:** A technical bridge allowing users to move assets between chains.

* **Mechanism:** Users perform Native Token Transfers (NTT) via Wormhole.
* **Revenue Model (Revised):**
    * **Old (Risky):** Charging a "convenience fee" on the transfer.
    * **New (Safe):** **Solver Rebates.** The third-party "Solver" or "Relayer" that executes the gas swap pays Conxius a "Technology Integration Fee" for routing the volume. We do not mark up the gas itself.

#### Bitcoin Consolidation (Formerly "Purification") 🧛
Incentives for users to consolidate assets into Bitcoin-native layers.

1.  **The "Consolidation" Score:**
    * **Hook:** "Optimize your sovereignty. Consolidate derived assets to Bitcoin."
    * **Reward:** +50 Sovereignty Points for actions that reduce dependency on centralized stablecoins.
2.  **The "Dust Sweeper":**
    * **Hook:** "Convert scattered dust to usable Sats."
    * **Revenue:** Spread captured by the swap provider, shared with Conxius.

## 2. Prohibited Revenue Models (The "Red Lines")

To maintain our "Software Provider" regulatory status, Conxian Labs **strictly prohibits**:

* **x** Taking a percentage of "Assets Under Management" (AUM).
* **x** Charging "Performance Fees" or guaranteeing returns.
* **x** Providing "Investment Advice" (e.g., predicting asset appreciation).
* **x** Internal market making or spread capture on user trades.
* **x** Holding user fiat in a Conxian bank account.
* **x** Charging "Transmission Fees" that would classify us as a Money Transmitter.
