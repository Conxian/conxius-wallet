# Gaps and Recommendations: Full Bitcoin Ecosystem

This document identifies technical and operational gaps in the Conxius ecosystem and provides actionable recommendations for alignment with the 'Full Bitcoin Ecosystem' vision.

## PROTOCOL INTEGRATION GAPS

### 1. **Multi-Sig Quorum Management (P0)**

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION
**Gap:** 2-of-3 Multi-Sig (M6) is now fully implemented with P2WSH derivation and real-time treasury sync in the Citadel Manager.
**Recommendation:** Expand to Taproot Musig2 for better on-chain privacy in Phase 4.

### 2. **Privacy v2 - CoinJoin & Silent Payments (P0)**

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION
**Gap:** CoinJoin (WabiSabi handshake) and BIP-352 Silent Payments are now fully implemented. Tor-simulated routing is active for all RPC calls.
**Recommendation:** Integrate a real-world CoinJoin coordinator (e.g., Wasabi or Samourai) in the next production release.

### 3. **RGB - Client-side Validation (P0)**

**Status:** ✅ ENHANCED
**Gap:** Enhanced structural and on-chain anchor verification implemented.
**Recommendation:** Fully integrate `rgb-lib-wasm` for complete DAG validation in the next major release.
