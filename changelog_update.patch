### Added

- **Persistent Crypto Worker**: Ported high-performance primitives to a singleton Web Worker model (`services/crypto.worker.ts`). This eliminates worker spawning overhead and implements session-level caching for PBKDF2 (200k+ iterations) and BIP32 derivation nodes, targeting a >90% reduction in address derivation latency.
- **ECC Engine Fusion**: Integrated `@noble/curves` for high-speed point arithmetic, specifically for Taproot tweaking using BigInt-level coordinate access (`P.hasEvenY()`). Retained `tiny-secp256k1` for deterministic signing compatibility.
- **Interlayer Orchestration**: Transitioned NTT execution to PRODUCTION status. Replaced placeholders with real `NTT_CONFIGS` for sBTC and cross-chain transfers. Parallelized transaction retrieval using `Promise.all` and integrated real-time VAA retrieval via the Wormhole API.
- **Memory Hardening**: Maintained strict 'Zero-Leak' memory hardening by zero-filling sensitive buffers in `finally` blocks and ensuring session-level caches are cleared on lock/reset.
